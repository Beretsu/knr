I provide two solution; one mimics the unix program "fold", and the other
is similar to "fold" but it folds after the last non-white char before the n'th
column as opposed to folding after the last char before the n'th column.
Both programs include an option like "fold -s". The one that mimics "fold"
folds after the last white char before the n'th column, and the other folds
after the last char of the last word before the n'th column.
